# Data_Visualization
## Introduction
An online retail store has hired me as a consultant to review its data and provide insights to the CEO and CMO. They are interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective with the intention of expanding the business.     

**Tools**
- Tableau
## Cleanup
Probably the shortest cleanup I have done. Just excluded the data that had 0 or less in Unit Price and below 1 in Quantity. When the visuals required specific information like the country or customer, I also excluded null or unknown values.

## Analysis
### Q1. CEO: What are the seasonal trends for revenue in 2011?

Here we can that there appears to be a sudden increase in revenue starting from September and going all the way to November. It might have extended to December but the data cuts at 12/9/2011. Though for only 1/3 of the month and with the previous trend in mind, the revenue would likely have either reached November or even exceeded it. With that all in mind, it is clear that there is a seasonal trend starting from September to likely December. With expansion in mind, it would be important to have far more products ready during those demanding months and you will gain even greater revenue. 
### Q2. CMO: Who are the top 10 countries excluding the UK with the highest generated revenue? How many products have they ordered?

This here shows us the top 10 highest revenue-generating countries excluding the UK. IT would appear that the Netherlands provides the most revenue at 285,446 shortly followed by Ireland which is EIRE behind by nearly 2,000. However, something interesting to note is that Ireland only acquired 147,000 which is below 3/4 of the Netherlands at 200,000. With a stronger presence through a marketing campaign or similar, the potential revenue should far exceed the Netherlands. However, it would be my opinion that expansion should be considered in the Netherlands as the countries with the next highest revenues, Germany and France, are closer and more accessible to both.
### Q3. CMO: Who are our top 10 customers by revenue?

The column chart here shows us the top 10 highest revenue-generating customers. We can see that the top 2 customers are much higher at 280,000 and nearly 260,000. This is nearly 70,000 more than the next highest at 194,000. The top 2 customers make up about 38.5% of the generated revenue from the top 10. Include the third and that jumps up to 52.3%. It would be crucial to keep at the very least these 3 customers satisfied as they make the largest contribution in revenue out of the 10 of them.
### Q4. CEO: Which countries had the highest demand for the products?

For this graph, the whole map won't be shown as this area holds the most important information. The countries with the highest demand are shown here. A dark red indicates high demand while gold shows a low demand. Once again we can see that the Netherlands is the highest in demand for products followed by Ireland, Germany, and France. As I mentioned before, it would be best to expand to the Netherlands which becomes clearer in this graph. The reason why is that expanding here means that a benefits both Germany and France. Germany's borders directly touch the Netherlands and are accessible to France by land. This would cause demand to grow from both resulting in greater revenue gain. That is why expanding in the Netherlands would be the most beneficial path as it would not only improve its revenue generated but Germany, and France as well.
